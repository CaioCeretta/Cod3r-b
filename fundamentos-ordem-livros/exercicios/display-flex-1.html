  Display flex explanation:

  When we use the display flex, we apply it to some element, so, for example

  we have a container div, which is flex, and we'll call it a flex container
  
  inside of it we have our elements, for example. any 3 divs

  By default, if we don't apply any style to a div, it will have a display block, and each div will occupy its own line,
  but by the time we say that this div is container, is a flex container, which have many internal divs, it will place
  the elements side by side at the same row (respecting the container width)

  Justify content will always be on the main axis and it is defined by the flex direction, so colum is vertical and row
  is horizontal, meanwhile the cross axis is just the opposite
  
  1. Justify Content Attributes
 
    flex-start: default, every element will be on the start of the line
    flex-end: the elements are organized at the end of the line
    center: the elements are organized in the center
    space-between: the items align at the edges of the container, and the remaining space is evenly distributed only
    between the items.
    space-around: same as the justify between, but there will also be a margin before the first and after the last 
    space-evenly: the spacing is uniform, not just between items but also between the items and the container's boundaries.

    - Difference between around and evenly: while space around outer spaces are smaller than the inner spaces, in the evenly
    all spaces are equal

    - End Explanation
  
  If we were to, set the flex container height to 400px, we will npw have a spacing on the cross axis,  and we'll now
  be able to, organize both in the main axis and on the cross axis, and this is done by the align-items.

  If we don't have a fixed height to the parent container, we will see that there will be no difference if i place it as
  start or end, because the container will have enpugh space to fit the children, if the biggest children is 200px tall
  the flex container will only be 200px tall

  2. Align Items Attributes

  start: default attribute for the align-items, 
  end: push the elements to the bottom of the parent container if it has space left  
  stretch: If we didn't have the height on the children, it would take all the available height, by default the div without
  any height, would only take the height of the element's box
  center: Place it on the center, just like start or end

  3. Flex-1

  Flex 1 will allow that this element will increase its size, based on the empty spaces that the container has, if, for example
  the container is 600px wide, and has 3 children with the width of 100px; in the end that container will have 300px of
  empty space, and if we utilize the flex-1 in one child, which will determine the flex-grow to be 1, it will end up
  taking 400px, while the other two keep occupying only 100px

  the flex: 1, basically says that the element will have

  flex-grow: 1 - Defines the capacity of the item to grow more than its base size, which means that if no other element
  has a flex-grow, it will take the whole space by itself. If every other element also have a flex grow of 1, they will
  share the remaining empty space, so each element will take up to 200px

  flex-shrink: 1 - Defines the capacity of the item to shrink when the container space is less than the sum of the items
  width, the value 1 means that the item can shrink proportionally to the insufficient space.
  If every other element has the same flex-shrink, they will all shrink equally

  flex-basis: 0 - The flex basis define the initial base size of the item, before considering the growth or the shrinking,
  the value 0 means that the base size is 0, and it will depend mainly of the flex-grow and the flex-shrink to adjust its
  final size.

  There are other ways of assigning the value to the flex attribute

  flex: 0 1 auto; which is the default, it doesn't grow, shrinks as necessary and the base size is defined by the content
  width / height
  flex: 2; which means that the flex-grow is 2, shrink 1 and basis 0, so it will grow twice as fast as the others with
  grow 1
