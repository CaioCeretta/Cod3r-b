			# Flex Grow

			Flex grow equal in an example of three items

			only one element has the flex-grow, this will make only this element to take all the available space. because the
			default is 0 and it will take the minimum size it takes to be rendered
			two elements have the flex-grow of 1, they both will divide all the left over space, while the third one who has
			the flex-grow of 0, will take only the needed space
			three elements have the flex-grow, this will make the three elements to take all the available empty space equally

			Flex grow higher in one or more elements

			If, for example, two elements have the flex grow of 1, but one the other has a flex-grow of 2, they will take all
			the available space, but the element with the grow bigger than the others. The calculation we do is not simply it will
			be twice the size of the ones with grow-1, but it will grow more than the others, so it would be, for example

			we have a div, of 400px and 3 items, let's say that three of them have the flex-grow of 1, so they will each one of them
			have something like 133px, if one of them have the flex-grow-2, while the others have of 1, the calculation would be

			Sum of the weights: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4
			Each unity has the space equivalent to 400px / 4 = 100px

			So by distributing the space it would be

			each of the items of flex grow 1 would have 100px and the one with flex-grow: 2, will have 200px

			this calculation will work in any cases, like for example 2 elements have flex-grow of 4 and one have the flex-grow
			of 12. 4 + 4 + 12 = 20, then it will be
			
			400 / 20, that is 20px for unity of weight, 

			so the first item with flex 12 will have 12 x 20 that is 240px
			and the others 80

			# Flex Shrink

			Flex Shrink has basically the same functionality as the growth, but it is the ability of an element to shrink to fit
			the container width, instead of growing to occupy the available space
