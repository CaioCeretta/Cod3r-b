		<!-- Position Recap Pt. 2

		fixed: 
			
		to use it on a fixed position, remove it from the normal flow and positioned relative to the viewport (the browser window)
		So it won't have an initial positioning, and if we don't specify any top, right..., the browser doesn't know where to place
		the element and by default, the element stayts at its original positiion, but because it's no longer in the flow, other
		elements might overlap it, effectively making it invisible.
		To bring it back we need to add a positioning to it.
		The differences from fixed to absolute, is that if we scroll down the page, it will keep the position in the viewport,
		but if it was absolute it wouldn't and the fixed is positioned relative to the viewport, whereas the absolute is to
		the nearest container.

		One other thing about fixed we have to remember is, because it's based on the viewport, when we have a explicit height set
		the top value will take precedence, and the element will be placed at top: 200px, without adjusting to the bottom constraint,
		but if we didn't have a explicit height and both top and bottom are defined, the height will stretch to fill the space
		between those two values.
		The same happens to the width, if we didn't have a fixed width, but have a left and right positioning it would stretch
		to fit the space between the left and right

		sticky: 

		Sticky is similar to fixed, but the main difference is that sticky toggles between relative and fixed positioning based
		on the user's scroll position.

		So fixed always stay on the viewport, independent of the scroll or containing block, whereas sticky combines aspect of
		relative an fixed and sticks to a position only within scrollable area of its containing block
