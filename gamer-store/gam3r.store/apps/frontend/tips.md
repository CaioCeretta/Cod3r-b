One good way of naming properties is by or following a common pattern, such as, if we're talking about prices

utilize

normalPrice, highestPrice, averagePrice

and always utilize naming as we would normally use, for example, we don't say priceHigher or things like that, so it's a good
practice to name those things, as similar as possible to how the team communicates, because this helps the business to be
more explicit, everyone will be talking the same language, etc
