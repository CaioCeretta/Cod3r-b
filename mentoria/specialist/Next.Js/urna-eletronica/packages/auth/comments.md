  ● Id generation

    ○ There is a discussion about the id generation, the id generation "timing" is important for us to know if we want to
    generate it before creating an object / during the object creation / only when we are going to persist it in the db, and
    all of this will influentiate the choice of the id type , for example, some question like these will arise: 
      . Does it make sense for us to go to the database, grab the id sequence and bring it to the app, or is it better to
      create an ID inside our code, as a unique identifier?
    ○ Everything depends on the application's requisites, we do not have necessarily a better approach than the other, for
    instance, UUID is large, and a numerical ID is smaller, occupying less space inside the DB (even though it is not determinant,
    it is not it that will make our db too big, but this choice is a factor worth considering).
    ○ We may also consider that: "If i generate an uuid, i can generate it in any time in the app with no persisting mechanism
    needeed for it" so inside our app we can generate it in a very fast manner with no need to go into the db, because they
    can be generated by the time the object is being created.
      ■ All of this can be used in our favor depending the approach we're taking, meaning that it depends more on the requisites
      than choosing a "better one"
    
● Exports approach

  ○ Within folders like constants, model, services, etc, a good approach is to centralize all the exports by creating
  an index file at the root of each folder. This file imports everything inside the folder and re-exports it.
  ○ The reason for this hiearchical export structure is that at the root of the project — for example, outside the `user`
  folder — we can control what to export, and then simply do `e.g export * from '/usuarios'` (or other folders) in a
  centralized way
  ○ Normally, this index file will only consist of exports of each one exported individually in each folder. Instead
  of creating a structuree of everything we want to export in the package (and can turn out to be enormous), it is
  better to do it hierarchically. 

● Page name conflict

  ○ If we were to create a page.tsx inside an (internal) folder and other one inside a (external) folder, both of these
  pages would conflict, since they would point to the same place, the (folderName) group folder is just for making it easier
  for a developer to read it, it won't be considered in our project URL
    ■ For example, let's say we have a page.tsx inside the (externa) group where we want to make it our login screen
      □ To fix this, first of all we are going to create a inicio folder, without the parentheses, and place the home
      component into that folder, meaning that inicio will be on the address
      □ In the end, the main index.tsx will be the login page, and check if the user is logged in, if so, he will be moved
      to the inicio/index.tsx
      □ I left the item above as educational purposes, the login page, will be placed on a route group (externa), and
      inside a auth folder
